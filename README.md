# scripts
I will upload some scripts I use on the GNU/Linux desktop, whether it's something I made myself or took from someone else

player - Bash script to call when you press the play/pause button. I made it a year ago or so to get a little experience with bash scripting.
Depending on whether it sees spotifyy open it will call playerctl or sp. You can change the variable inside for a little bit of customizabilty and
of course you need both programs installed.
  Here is sp if it is not in your distro's repo: https://gist.github.com/wandernauta/6800547
  Likewise with playerctl: https://github.com/altdesktop/playerctl
